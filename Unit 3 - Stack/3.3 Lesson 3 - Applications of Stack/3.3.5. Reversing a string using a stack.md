# 3.3.5. Reversing a string using a stack
## Overview
This C program demonstrates the application of a stack data structure to reverse a given string. It takes an input string from the user, reverses it using a stack, and then displays the reversed string.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this program is to illustrate the use of a stack in reversing a string. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which makes it an ideal candidate for reversing a sequence of characters. By pushing each character of the input string onto the stack and then popping them off, the program effectively reverses the order of the characters.

## Key Features
* Uses a stack data structure to reverse a string
* Implements push and pop operations for the stack
* Reverses a string by pushing each character onto the stack and then popping them off
* Handles stack overflow and underflow conditions
* Provides a simple command-line interface for user input and output

## Data Structures Used
The program uses an array `arr` to implement the stack. The array has a fixed size `STACK_MAX_SIZE`, which is defined as 30. The stack is managed using the `top` variable, which keeps track of the current top element of the stack.

## Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm for reversing a string using a stack can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Push each character of the input string onto the stack.
2. Pop each character off the stack and store it in the original string, effectively reversing the order of the characters.
The `reverse` function implements this algorithm by iterating over the input string, pushing each character onto the stack, and then popping them off and storing them back in the original string.

## Functions
### `push(char element)`
* Parameters: `element` - the character to be pushed onto the stack
* Return Value: None
* Description: Pushes a character onto the stack if it is not full. If the stack is full, it prints an error message.

### `pop()`
* Parameters: None
* Return Value: The character popped off the stack, or -1 if the stack is empty
* Description: Pops a character off the stack if it is not empty. If the stack is empty, it prints an error message and returns -1.

### `reverse(char str[])`
* Parameters: `str` - the input string to be reversed
* Return Value: None
* Description: Reverses the input string using a stack.

### `main()`
* Parameters: None
* Return Value: None
* Description: The main function that takes user input, reverses the string, and displays the result.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
gcc 3.3.5.\ Reversing\ a\ string\ using\ a\ stack.c -o reverse_string
```
This will generate an executable file `reverse_string` that can be run from the command line.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
./reverse_string
```
The program will prompt the user to enter a string. After entering a string, the program will display the reversed string.

## Input/Output
* Input: A string entered by the user
* Output: The reversed string

## Time and Space Complexity
* Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the program iterates over the input string twice: once to push the characters onto the stack and once to pop them off.
* Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the program uses a stack to store the characters, and the maximum size of the stack is equal to the length of the input string.

## Edge Cases
The program handles the following edge cases:
* Empty input string: The program will not crash or produce incorrect results if the user enters an empty string.
* Stack overflow: The program checks for stack overflow and prints an error message if the stack is full.

## Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* Fixed stack size: The program uses a fixed-size array to implement the stack, which means that it can only handle input strings up to a certain length.
* No error handling for invalid input: The program does not check for invalid input, such as null characters or non-string input.

## Example Run
Here is an example run of the program:
```
Enter a string : hello
The reverse of a given string : olleh
```
Note that the program correctly reverses the input string and displays the result.

# 3.3.4. Reversing an array using stack
## 📋 Overview
This C program reverses an array of integers using a stack data structure. It takes an array of integers as input, reverses the order of its elements using a stack, and then prints the reversed array.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a stack data structure to reverse an array of integers. This is a common problem in computer science, and the use of a stack provides an efficient solution. The program exists to solve the problem of reversing an array, which is a fundamental operation in many algorithms and data structures.

## ✨ Key Features
* Reverses an array of integers using a stack data structure
* Implements basic stack operations (push and pop)
* Handles invalid input sizes and stack overflow/underflow conditions
* Provides example usage and output

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses two data structures:
* **Array**: A one-dimensional array `arr` of size 30 is used to store the input integers.
* **Stack**: A stack is implemented using an array `arr` (different from the input array) and an integer `top` to keep track of the top element of the stack. The stack is used to reverse the input array.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm works as follows:
1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the input array.
2. The program checks if the input size is valid (greater than 0). If not, it prints an error message and exits.
3. The program prompts the user to enter each element of the input array.
4. The program prints the original input array.
5. The program pushes all elements of the input array onto the stack using the `push` function.
6. The program pops all elements from the stack back into the input array using the `pop` function, effectively reversing the array.
7. The program prints the reversed array.

### Functions Documentation
- **`push(long int element)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Pushes an element onto the stack.
  - **Parameters**: `element` (the integer to be pushed onto the stack).
  - **Returns**: None.
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is full, and if not, increments the `top` index and stores the element at the new `top` index.
- **`int pop()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Pops an element from the stack.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: The popped element (or -1 if the stack is underflow).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, and if not, returns the element at the current `top` index and decrements the `top` index.
- **`void main()`**:
  - **Purpose**: The main entry point of the program.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None.
  - **Logic**: Implements the main algorithm, including prompting the user for input, printing the original and reversed arrays, and handling invalid input sizes and stack overflow/underflow conditions.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "3.3.4. Reversing an array using stack.c" -o 3.3.4. Reversing an array using stack
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./3.3.4. Reversing an array using stack
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:
* **Array size**: The user is prompted to enter the size of the input array.
* **Array elements**: The user is prompted to enter each element of the input array.

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* **Original array**: The program prints the original input array.
* **Reversed array**: The program prints the reversed array after applying the stack-based reversal algorithm.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the program performs a constant amount of work for each element of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the program uses a stack to store all elements of the input array, which requires additional memory proportional to the size of the input array.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter the size of the array : 5
Enter arr[0] : 1
Enter arr[1] : 2
Enter arr[2] : 3
Enter arr[3] : 4
Enter arr[4] : 5
Array before reversing : 1 2 3 4 5
Array after reversing : 5 4 3 2 1
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* **Invalid input size**: The program checks if the input size is valid (greater than 0) and prints an error message if not.
* **Stack overflow**: The program checks if the stack is full before pushing an element onto it and prints an error message if the stack is overflow.
* **Stack underflow**: The program checks if the stack is empty before popping an element from it and prints an error message if the stack is underflow.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* **Fixed stack size**: The program uses a fixed-size stack, which may not be sufficient for large input arrays.
* **Integer overflow**: The program uses `int` to store the stack elements, which may cause integer overflow for large input values.
* **No error handling for `scanf`**: The program does not check the return value of `scanf`, which may cause undefined behavior if the input is invalid.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a simple implementation of a stack-based array reversal algorithm. It demonstrates the use of a stack data structure to solve a common problem in computer science. However, it has limitations and potential issues, such as fixed stack size and integer overflow, which should be considered when using this program in practice.

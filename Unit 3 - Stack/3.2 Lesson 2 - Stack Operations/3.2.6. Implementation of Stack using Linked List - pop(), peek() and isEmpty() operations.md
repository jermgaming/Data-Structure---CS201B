# 3.2.6. Implementation of Stack using Linked List - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a stack data structure using a linked list, providing functions for common stack operations such as push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and display. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a stack using a linked list in C, showcasing the basic operations that can be performed on a stack. This program can serve as a foundation for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms that rely on stacks.

## ✨ Key Features
* Implementation of a stack using a linked list
* Support for push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and display operations
* Dynamic memory allocation for nodes in the linked list
* Error handling for edge cases such as stack overflow and underflow

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program defines a struct `stack` to represent a node in the linked list, containing an integer `data` field and a `next` pointer to the next node in the list. The `top` pointer is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms:
* Linked list insertion: The `push` function uses a linked list insertion algorithm to add new elements to the top of the stack.
* Linked list deletion: The `pop` function uses a linked list deletion algorithm to remove the top element from the stack.
* Linked list traversal: The `display` function uses a linked list traversal algorithm to print the elements of the stack.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `pop()`
  - **Purpose**: Removes the top element from the stack and returns the new top element.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: The new top element (or NULL if the stack is empty)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, saves the value of the top element, updates the `top` pointer, frees the memory allocated for the removed node, and returns the new top element.
- **Function Name**: `peek()`
  - **Purpose**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (prints the top element to the console)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty and prints the value of the top element if it's not.
- **Function Name**: `isEmpty()`
  - **Purpose**: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (prints a message to the console indicating whether the stack is empty)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the `top` pointer is NULL and prints a message accordingly.
- **Function Name**: `push(int x)`
  - **Purpose**: Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
  - **Parameters**: `x` (the value to be added to the stack)
  - **Returns**: The new top element (or NULL if the stack is full)
  - **Logic**: Allocates memory for a new node, sets the value of the new node, updates the `next` pointer of the new node, and updates the `top` pointer.
- **Function Name**: `display()`
  - **Purpose**: Prints the elements of the stack to the console.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None
  - **Logic**: Traverses the linked list and prints the value of each node.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "3.2.6. Implementation of Stack using Linked List - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations.c" -o 3.2.6. Implementation of Stack using Linked List - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./3.2.6. Implementation of Stack using Linked List - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects integer values to be added to the stack using the `push` function and user requests to perform stack operations (e.g., `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, `display`).

### Output
The program produces messages indicating the result of stack operations (e.g., "Popped value = X", "Stack is empty", etc.) and prints the elements of the stack to the console using the `display` function.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `push` function: O(1) (constant time)
  - `pop` function: O(1) (constant time)
  - `peek` function: O(1) (constant time)
  - `isEmpty` function: O(1) (constant time)
  - `display` function: O(n) (linear time, where n is the number of elements in the stack)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (linear space, where n is the number of elements in the stack)

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Successfully pushed.
Elements of the stack are : 3 
Popped value = 3
Stack is empty.
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* Empty stack: The `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty` functions check if the stack is empty and print an error message if it is.
* Full stack: The `push` function checks if memory allocation fails and prints an error message if it is.
* Invalid input: The program does not handle invalid input explicitly, but it will behave correctly if the input values are valid integers.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* Memory leaks: The program uses `malloc` to allocate memory for new nodes, but it does not check if the allocation fails. If the allocation fails, the program will print an error message but will not free the memory.
* Stack overflow: The program does not check if the stack is full before pushing a new element. If the stack is full, the program will print an error message but will not prevent the stack from overflowing.
* Limited functionality: The program only provides basic stack operations and does not provide more advanced functionality such as searching or sorting.

## 📝 Notes
This program demonstrates the implementation of a stack using a linked list in C, highlighting the basic operations that can be performed on a stack. It serves as a foundation for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms that rely on stacks.

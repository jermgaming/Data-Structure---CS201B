# 3.2.3. Implementation of Stack using Arrays - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a stack data structure using an array, providing basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and display. The program allows users to perform these operations on the stack and provides feedback on the success or failure of each operation.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a stack using an array, which is a fundamental data structure in computer science. The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This program provides a basic understanding of how a stack works and how to implement it using an array.

## ✨ Key Features
* Implementation of a stack using an array
* Basic stack operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and display
* Error handling for stack underflow and overflow conditions
* Example usage of the stack operations

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses an array `arr` to store the elements of the stack, and a variable `top` to keep track of the index of the top element. The array is defined with a fixed size `STACK_MAX_SIZE`, which determines the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the stack.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithm to implement the stack operations:
1. The `push()` function checks if the stack is full by comparing the `top` index with the maximum size of the array. If the stack is full, it prints an "overflow" message and returns.
2. If the stack is not full, the `push()` function increments the `top` index and stores the new element at the corresponding index in the `arr` array.
3. The `pop()` function checks if the stack is empty by comparing the `top` index with -1. If the stack is empty, it prints an "underflow" message and returns.
4. If the stack is not empty, the `pop()` function decrements the `top` index and prints the value of the top element.
5. The `peek()` function checks if the stack is empty by comparing the `top` index with -1. If the stack is empty, it prints an "underflow" message and returns.
6. If the stack is not empty, the `peek()` function prints the value of the top element without modifying the `top` index.
7. The `isEmpty()` function checks if the stack is empty by comparing the `top` index with -1. If the stack is empty, it prints an "empty" message.
8. The `display()` function checks if the stack is empty by comparing the `top` index with -1. If the stack is empty, it prints an "empty" message and returns.
9. If the stack is not empty, the `display()` function prints all elements in the stack by iterating over the `arr` array from the `top` index down to 0.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `pop()`
  - **Purpose**: Removes the top element from the stack and prints its value.

- **Function Name**: `peek()`

- **Function Name**: `isEmpty()`
  - **Purpose**: Checks if the stack is empty and prints a message accordingly.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None
  - **Logic**: Checks if the `top` index is -1, and if so, prints an "empty" message.
- **Function Name**: `push(int element)`
  - **Purpose**: Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
  - **Parameters**: `element` - the value to be added to the stack
  - **Returns**: None
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is full, and if not, increments the `top` index and stores the new element at the corresponding index in the `arr` array.
- **Function Name**: `display()`
  - **Purpose**: Prints all elements in the stack.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, and if not, prints all elements in the stack by iterating over the `arr` array from the `top` index down to 0.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "3.2.3. Implementation of Stack using Arrays - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations.c" -o 3.2.3. Implementation of Stack using Arrays - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./3.2.3. Implementation of Stack using Arrays - pop(), peek() and isEmpty() operations
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:
* `element` parameter in the `push()` function: an integer value to be added to the stack.

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* Success or failure messages for each operation (e.g., "Popped value = X", "Stack is underflow.", etc.).
* The values of the elements in the stack when the `display()` function is called.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  * `push()`: O(1) because the program only increments the `top` index and stores the new element at the corresponding index in the `arr` array.
  * `pop()`: O(1) because the program only decrements the `top` index and prints the value of the top element.
  * `peek()`: O(1) because the program only prints the value of the top element without modifying the `top` index.
  * `isEmpty()`: O(1) because the program only checks if the stack is empty.
  * `display()`: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack, because the program iterates over the `arr` array to print all elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the maximum size of the stack, because the program uses an array of size `STACK_MAX_SIZE` to store the elements of the stack.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
push(2)
Successfully pushed.
push(3)
Successfully pushed.
display()
Elements of the stack are : 3 2 
pop()
Popped value = 3
display()
Elements of the stack are : 2 
peek()
Peek value = 2
isEmpty()
Stack is not empty.
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* Stack underflow: When the `pop()` or `peek()` function is called on an empty stack, the program prints an "underflow" message and returns.
* Stack overflow: When the `push()` function is called on a full stack, the program prints an "overflow" message and returns.
* Empty stack: When the `display()` function is called on an empty stack, the program prints an "empty" message and returns.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* Fixed-size stack: The program uses a fixed-size array to store the elements of the stack, which means that the stack has a limited capacity.
* No error handling: The program does not handle errors such as invalid input or memory allocation errors.
* No bounds checking: The program does not check if the input to the `push()` function is within the valid range of integers.
* No thread safety: The program is not thread-safe, meaning that it is not designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment.

## 📝 Notes
This program provides a basic implementation of a stack using an array and demonstrates the basic stack operations. However, it has limitations and does not handle all edge cases. In a real-world scenario, a more robust implementation of a stack would be required, with additional error handling and bounds checking.

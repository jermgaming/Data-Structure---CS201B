# 3.2.4. Operations on Stack using Arrays
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a stack data structure using an array and provides functions to perform various operations on the stack, such as pushing, popping, peeking, displaying, and checking if the stack is empty. The program demonstrates the basic functionality of a stack, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide a basic implementation of a stack data structure using an array, which can be useful in a variety of applications such as evaluating postfix expressions, parsing syntax, and implementing recursive algorithms. The program aims to educate users on how to implement a stack using an array and how to perform common stack operations.

## ✨ Key Features
* Implementation of a stack data structure using an array
* Functions to push, pop, peek, display, and check if the stack is empty
* Error handling for stack overflow and underflow
* Example usage of the stack operations

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses an array to implement the stack data structure. The array is defined with a fixed size of 10 elements, and the `top` variable is used to keep track of the top element of the stack. The `top` variable is initialized to -1, indicating an empty stack.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms to implement the stack operations:
1. **Stack push algorithm**: The `push` function checks if the stack is full (i.e., `top` is equal to `size-1`). If it is, it prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, it increments the `top` variable and stores the element at the new `top` index in the array.
2. **Stack pop algorithm**: The `pop` function checks if the stack is empty (i.e., `top` is equal to `-1`). If it is, it prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, it prints the top element and decrements the `top` variable.
3. **Stack peek algorithm**: The `peek` function checks if the stack is empty (i.e., `top` is equal to `-1`). If it is, it prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, it prints the top element.
4. **Stack display algorithm**: The `display` function checks if the stack is empty (i.e., `top` is equal to `-1`). If it is, it prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, it prints all elements in the stack by iterating from the top element to the bottom element.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `push(int element)`
  - **Purpose**: Pushes an element onto the stack.
  - **Parameters**: `int element` (the element to be pushed).
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is full, increments the `top` variable, and stores the element at the new `top` index in the array.
- **Function Name**: `display()`
  - **Purpose**: Displays the elements of the stack.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, then prints all elements in the stack by iterating from the top element to the bottom element.
- **Function Name**: `pop()`
  - **Purpose**: Pops an element from the stack.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, then prints the top element and decrements the `top` variable.
- **Function Name**: `peek()`
  - **Purpose**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, then prints the top element.
- **Function Name**: `isEmpty()`
  - **Purpose**: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: Checks if the stack is empty, then prints a message indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "3.2.4. Operations on Stack using Arrays.c" -o 3.2.4. Operations on Stack using Arrays
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./3.2.4. Operations on Stack using Arrays
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program does not take any explicit inputs from the user. However, the `push` function takes an integer element as a parameter, which can be considered as input.

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* "Stack is overflow." (when the stack is full and an element is pushed)
* "Stack is underflow." (when the stack is empty and an element is popped or peeked)
* "Successfully pushed." (when an element is pushed successfully)
* "Popped value = <value>" (when an element is popped)
* "Peek value = <value>" (when the top element is peeked)
* "Elements of the stack are: <elements>" (when the stack is displayed)
* "Stack is empty." (when the stack is empty)
* "Stack is not empty." (when the stack is not empty)

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  * `push` function: O(1) (constant time)
  * `display` function: O(n) (linear time, where n is the number of elements in the stack)
  * `pop` function: O(1) (constant time)
  * `peek` function: O(1) (constant time)
  * `isEmpty` function: O(1) (constant time)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. This is because the program uses an array of size `size` to store the elements of the stack.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Successfully pushed.
Elements of the stack are: 10 
Popped value = 10
Stack is empty.
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* **Stack overflow**: When the stack is full and an element is pushed, the program prints an error message and returns.
* **Stack underflow**: When the stack is empty and an element is popped or peeked, the program prints an error message and returns.
* **Empty stack**: When the stack is empty, the program prints an error message and returns.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* **Fixed size**: The program uses a fixed-size array to store the elements of the stack, which can lead to stack overflow errors if the stack grows beyond the fixed size.
* **No error handling for invalid inputs**: The program does not handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values, which can lead to undefined behavior.
* **No support for multiple stacks**: The program only supports a single stack, which can limit its usefulness in certain applications.

## 📝 Notes
This program provides a basic implementation of a stack data structure using an array and demonstrates the common stack operations. However, it has some limitations, such as fixed size and lack of error handling, which can be addressed in future versions of the program.

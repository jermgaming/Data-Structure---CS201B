# 1.2.2. Understanding one dimensional arrays
## 📋 Overview
This C program demonstrates the understanding and usage of one-dimensional arrays. It allows the user to input a specified number of integer values, stores them in an array, and then displays the stored array elements.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to illustrate the basics of one-dimensional arrays in C programming, including declaration, initialization, and manipulation of array elements. It solves the problem of storing and displaying a collection of integer values.

## ✨ Key Features
* Allows users to input a specified number of integer values
* Stores input values in a one-dimensional array
* Displays the stored array elements
* Uses `printf()` and `scanf()` functions for input/output operations
* Implements a simple iterative algorithm for reading and printing array elements

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The data structure used in this program is a one-dimensional array, specifically an integer array `a` with a fixed size of 10 elements. The array is defined as `int a[10];`, which allocates memory for 10 integer elements. The array elements are accessed using the index `i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to 9.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses a simple iterative algorithm to read and print array elements. The algorithm consists of two main steps:

1. Reading input values: The program prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to read, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate `n` times, allowing the user to input each individual value.
2. Printing array elements: After all values have been input, the program uses another `for` loop to iterate `n` times, printing each array element `a[i]` to the console.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: This is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (void)
  - **Logic**: The `main()` function declares an integer array `a` with a fixed size of 10 elements, and two integer variables `i` and `n`. It then prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to read, reads the input values using `scanf()`, and stores them in the array. Finally, it prints the stored array elements using `printf()`.
- **Function Name**: `printf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: This function is used for outputting formatted strings to the console.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and optional arguments to be formatted.
  - **Returns**: The number of characters printed.
  - **Logic**: The `printf()` function writes the formatted string to the console, replacing format specifiers with the corresponding argument values.
- **Function Name**: `scanf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: This function is used for reading input from the console and storing it in variables.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and pointers to variables where the input values will be stored.
  - **Returns**: The number of successful assignments.
  - **Logic**: The `scanf()` function reads input from the console, parses the input according to the format string, and stores the parsed values in the corresponding variables.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.2.2. Understanding one dimensional arrays.c" -o 1.2.2. Understanding one dimensional arrays
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.2.2. Understanding one dimensional arrays
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the user to input the following:

* The number of values the user wants to read (`n`)
* The individual integer values to be stored in the array (`a[i]`)

### Output
The program produces the following output:

* A prompt asking the user to enter the number of values they want to read
* Prompts asking the user to enter each individual value
* The stored array elements, printed to the console

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of values the user wants to read. This is because the program uses two `for` loops, each iterating `n` times.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of this program is O(1), because the size of the array is fixed (10 elements) and does not depend on the input size `n`. However, if the array size were dynamic, the space complexity would be O(n).

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter how many values you want to read : 5
Enter the value of a[0] : 10
Enter the value of a[1] : 20
Enter the value of a[2] : 30
Enter the value of a[3] : 40
Enter the value of a[4] : 50
The array elements are :  10  20  30  40  50
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle the following edge cases:

* The user enters a value of `n` greater than 10, which is the fixed size of the array.
* The user enters non-integer values when prompted to enter a value.
* The user enters a negative value for `n`.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:

* It uses a fixed-size array, which can lead to buffer overflow issues if the user enters a value of `n` greater than 10.
* It does not validate user input, which can lead to undefined behavior if the user enters invalid or unexpected input.
* It does not handle errors that may occur during input/output operations, such as file I/O errors or console I/O errors.

## 📝 Notes
To improve the program, consider the following:

* Use dynamic memory allocation to create an array of size `n`, rather than using a fixed-size array.
* Add input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid value for `n` and valid integer values for the array elements.
* Add error handling to handle cases where input/output operations fail or where the user enters invalid input.
* Consider using more robust input/output functions, such as `fgets()` and `sscanf()`, to handle user input and output.

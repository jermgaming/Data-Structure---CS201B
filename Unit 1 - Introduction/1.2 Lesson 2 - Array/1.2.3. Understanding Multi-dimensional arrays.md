# 1.2.3. Understanding Multi-dimensional arrays
## 📋 Overview
This C program demonstrates the concept of multi-dimensional arrays by allowing users to input the size of a matrix and its elements, and then displaying the entered matrix. It provides a simple and interactive way to understand how multi-dimensional arrays work in programming.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to educate users about multi-dimensional arrays, specifically two-dimensional arrays, and how they can be used to store and manipulate data in a tabular format. It helps users understand the concept of rows, columns, and indices in a matrix, and how to access and modify elements in a multi-dimensional array.

## ✨ Key Features
* Allows users to input the size of a matrix (number of rows and columns)
* Enables users to input the values of each element in the matrix
* Displays the entered matrix in a tabular format
* Uses two-dimensional arrays to store and manipulate the matrix data
* Includes input validation and error handling mechanisms (although limited)

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The primary data structure used in this program is a two-dimensional array, also known as a matrix. The array is declared as `int a[5][5]`, which means it can store a maximum of 5 rows and 5 columns of integer values. The array is used to store the user-inputted matrix data, and its elements are accessed and modified using indices (row and column numbers).

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses a simple algorithm to input and display the matrix data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Declare a two-dimensional array `a` with a maximum size of 5x5.
2. Prompt the user to input the row and column sizes using `printf()`.
3. Read the user-inputted row and column sizes using `scanf()` and store them in the variables `rows` and `cols`.
4. Use two nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.
5. Inside the inner loop, prompt the user to input the value of each matrix element using `printf()`.
6. Read the user-inputted value using `scanf()` and store it in the corresponding element of the array `a`.
7. After all matrix elements have been inputted, print a message indicating that the entered matrix will be displayed.
8. Use another pair of nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix and print each element using `printf()`.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: This is the entry point of the program, responsible for executing the main logic.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (technically, it returns an integer, but in this case, it is declared as `void`)
  - **Logic**: The `main()` function contains the entire program logic, including inputting and displaying the matrix data.

- **Function Name**: `printf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: Prints output to the console.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and a variable number of arguments to be printed.
  - **Returns**: The number of characters printed.
  - **Logic**: The `printf()` function is used to print messages, prompts, and the matrix data to the console.

- **Function Name**: `scanf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: Reads input from the console.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and a variable number of arguments to store the input values.
  - **Returns**: The number of successful assignments.
  - **Logic**: The `scanf()` function is used to read the user-inputted row and column sizes, as well as the matrix element values.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.2.3. Understanding Multi-dimensional arrays.c" -o 1.2.3. Understanding Multi-dimensional arrays
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.2.3. Understanding Multi-dimensional arrays
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:

* The number of rows and columns in the matrix, entered by the user.
* The values of the matrix elements, entered by the user.

### Output
The program produces the following output:

* A message prompting the user to enter the row and column sizes.
* A message prompting the user to enter each matrix element.
* The entered matrix, displayed in a tabular format.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because the program uses two nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(1), because the size of the array `a` is fixed at compile-time, regardless of the input size. However, if we consider the input size as a variable, the space complexity would be O(n*m), because the program needs to store the entire matrix in memory.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter row and column sizes : 3 3
Enter the value of a[0][0] : 1
Enter the value of a[0][1] : 2
Enter the value of a[0][2] : 3
Enter the value of a[1][0] : 4
Enter the value of a[1][1] : 5
Enter the value of a[1][2] : 6
Enter the value of a[2][0] : 7
Enter the value of a[2][1] : 8
Enter the value of a[2][2] : 9
The given matrix is
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle the following edge cases:

* If the user enters a row or column size greater than 5, the program will access memory outside the bounds of the array `a`, leading to undefined behavior.
* If the user enters a non-integer value for the row or column size, the program will produce incorrect results or crash.
* If the user enters a non-integer value for a matrix element, the program will produce incorrect results or crash.

To handle these edge cases, the program should add input validation and error handling mechanisms, such as checking the input values and handling errors using `errno` and `perror()`.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:

* The program uses a fixed-size array, which can lead to memory waste if the user enters a small matrix size.
* The program does not handle large input sizes, because the array size is limited to 5x5.
* The program does not provide any error handling or input validation mechanisms.

To address these limitations, the program could use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the array based on the input size, and add input validation and error handling mechanisms.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a simple demonstration of multi-dimensional arrays in C and is intended for educational purposes. It is not intended for production use and should not be used in critical applications without proper testing and validation.

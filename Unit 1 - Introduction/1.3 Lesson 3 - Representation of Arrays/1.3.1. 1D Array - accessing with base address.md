# 1.3.1. 1D Array - accessing with base address
## 📋 Overview
This C program demonstrates how to access and manipulate elements of a one-dimensional array using its base address. It prompts the user to input a specified number of integer values, stores them in an array, and then displays the stored values.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to illustrate the concept of array indexing and how to use the base address of an array to access its elements. This is a fundamental concept in programming, and understanding how to work with arrays is crucial for any aspiring programmer. The program provides a simple and interactive way to learn about array manipulation and indexing.

## ✨ Key Features
* Prompts the user to input a specified number of integer values
* Stores the input values in a one-dimensional array
* Displays the stored array elements using the base address of the array
* Demonstrates the use of `printf` and `scanf` functions for input/output operations
* Uses a simple iterative approach to read and display array elements

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The primary data structure used in this program is a one-dimensional array, specifically an integer array `a` with a fixed size of 10 elements. The array is used to store the input values provided by the user. In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. The base address of the array is the memory address of the first element of the array, and it can be used to access any element of the array using pointer arithmetic.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses a simple iterative approach to read and display the array elements. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the main algorithm:
1. Declare an integer array `a` with a fixed size of 10 elements, an integer variable `i` for indexing, and an integer variable `n` to store the number of values to read.
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of values they want to read using `printf`.
3. Read the user's input using `scanf` and store it in the variable `n`.
4. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array elements, starting from index 0 and going up to `n-1`.
5. Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter the value of each array element using `printf`.
6. Read the user's input using `scanf` and store it in the corresponding array element using the expression `a + i`, which is equivalent to `&a[i]`.
7. After reading all the input values, prompt the user that it will display the array elements.
8. Use another `for` loop to iterate over the array elements, starting from index 0 and going up to `n-1`.
9. Inside the loop, display the value of each array element using `printf` and the expression `*(a + i)`, which is equivalent to `a[i]`.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: Execute the program's main logic.
  - **Parameters**: None (in this implementation, although `main` can take arguments in standard C).
  - **Returns**: `void` (no return value).
  - **Logic**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it executes the main logic of the program.
- **Function Name**: `printf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: Print formatted output to the console.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and variable number of arguments.
  - **Returns**: The number of characters printed.
  - **Logic**: The `printf` function is used to print formatted output to the console. It takes a format string and variable number of arguments, and it returns the number of characters printed.
- **Function Name**: `scanf(format, ...)`
  - **Purpose**: Read formatted input from the console.
  - **Parameters**: A format string and variable number of arguments.
  - **Returns**: The number of successful assignments.
  - **Logic**: The `scanf` function is used to read formatted input from the console. It takes a format string and variable number of arguments, and it returns the number of successful assignments.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.3.1. 1D Array - accessing with base address.c" -o 1.3.1. 1D Array - accessing with base address
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.3.1. 1D Array - accessing with base address
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program takes the following inputs:
* An integer value `n`, representing the number of values the user wants to read.
* `n` integer values, which are stored in the array `a`.

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* A prompt asking the user to enter the number of values they want to read.
* Prompts asking the user to enter each individual value.
* The stored array elements, displayed on the console.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of values to read. The program uses two `for` loops to iterate over the array elements, and each loop iterates n times. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(1), since the array `a` has a fixed size of 10 elements, regardless of the input value `n`.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter how many values you want to read : 5
Enter the value of a[0] : 1
Enter the value of a[1] : 2
Enter the value of a[2] : 3
Enter the value of a[3] : 4
Enter the value of a[4] : 5
The array elements are :  1  2  3  4  5
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not include any explicit error handling or edge case handling. However, some potential edge cases to consider are:
* If the user enters a value of `n` that is greater than 10, the program will access memory outside the bounds of the array `a`, leading to undefined behavior.
* If the user enters a non-integer value for `n` or any of the array elements, the program will produce incorrect results or crash.
* If the user enters a negative value for `n`, the program will not behave as expected.

## 🚧 Limitations
Some potential issues or limitations of the program are:
* The array `a` has a fixed size of 10 elements, which may not be sufficient for larger input values of `n`.
* The program does not include any error handling or input validation, which can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
* The program uses `void main()`, which is not a standard signature for the `main` function in C.
* The program uses `scanf` to read input values, which can be prone to errors if the input is not in the expected format.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a simple demonstration of how to access and manipulate elements of a one-dimensional array using its base address. It is not intended for production use and is meant to be used as a learning tool. The program can be modified to include error handling and input validation to make it more robust. Additionally, the program can be extended to work with larger input values by using dynamic memory allocation for the array.

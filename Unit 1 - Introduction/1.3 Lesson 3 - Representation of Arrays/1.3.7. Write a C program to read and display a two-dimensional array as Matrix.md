# 1.3.7. Write a C program to read and display a two-dimensional array as Matrix
## 📋 Overview
This C program reads and displays a two-dimensional array as a matrix. It prompts the user to input the row and column sizes of the matrix, then reads the values of each element in the matrix, and finally displays the matrix.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide a simple and efficient way to input and display matrices. Matrices are fundamental data structures in linear algebra and are used to represent systems of linear equations, transformations, and other mathematical concepts. This program allows users to easily create and visualize matrices, making it a useful tool for students, researchers, and professionals in fields such as mathematics, physics, and computer science.

## ✨ Key Features
* Reads the row and column sizes of the matrix from the user
* Reads the values of each element in the matrix from the user
* Displays the matrix in a readable format
* Uses a two-dimensional array to store the matrix
* Uses nested loops to read and display the matrix

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The primary data structure used in this program is a two-dimensional array, also known as a matrix. A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a row in the matrix. In C, a two-dimensional array is declared using the following syntax: `int arr[n][m];`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm used in this program can be summarized as follows:
1. Read the row and column sizes of the matrix from the user.
2. Initialize a two-dimensional array with the specified row and column sizes.
3. Use nested loops to read the values of each element in the matrix:
	* The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix.
	* The inner loop iterates over the columns of the matrix.
	* For each element, read the value from the user and store it in the corresponding element of the two-dimensional array.
4. Use nested loops to display the matrix:
	* The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix.
	* The inner loop iterates over the columns of the matrix.
	* For each element, print the value to the console.

### Functions Documentation
* **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: This is the entry point of the program. It reads the row and column sizes of the matrix from the user, reads the values of each element in the matrix, and displays the matrix.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: An integer value indicating the program's exit status.
  - **Logic**: The `main()` function uses nested loops to read and display the matrix. It also uses the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions to interact with the user.
* **Function Name**: `printf()`
  - **Purpose**: This function is used to print formatted output to the console.
  - **Parameters**: A variable number of parameters, including a format string and the values to be printed.
  - **Returns**: The number of characters printed.
  - **Logic**: The `printf()` function uses a format string to determine how to print the values. For example, the format string `%d` is used to print an integer value.
* **Function Name**: `scanf()`
  - **Purpose**: This function is used to read formatted input from the console.
  - **Parameters**: A variable number of parameters, including a format string and the addresses of variables to store the input values.
  - **Returns**: The number of successful assignments.
  - **Logic**: The `scanf()` function uses a format string to determine how to read the input values. For example, the format string `%d` is used to read an integer value.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.3.7. Write a C program to read and display a two-dimensional array as Matrix.c" -o 1.3.7. Write a C program to read and display a two-dimensional array as Matrix
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.3.7. Write a C program to read and display a two-dimensional array as Matrix
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the user to input the following values:
* The row size of the matrix (an integer value)
* The column size of the matrix (an integer value)
* The values of each element in the matrix (integer values)

### Output
The program produces the following output:
* The displayed matrix with the input values

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because the program uses nested loops to read and display the matrix, and the number of iterations is proportional to the product of the row and column sizes.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because the program uses a two-dimensional array to store the matrix, and the size of the array is proportional to the product of the row and column sizes.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter row and column sizes : 2 2
Enter the value of arr[0][0] : 1
Enter the value of arr[0][1] : 2
Enter the value of arr[1][0] : 3
Enter the value of arr[1][1] : 4
The given matrix is
1 2
3 4
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle any edge cases or errors explicitly. However, some potential edge cases and errors that may occur include:
* If the user inputs a non-integer value for the row or column size, the program may behave unexpectedly or crash.
* If the user inputs a negative value for the row or column size, the program may behave unexpectedly or crash.
* If the user inputs a value that is too large for the row or column size, the program may run out of memory or crash.
* If the user inputs a non-integer value for an element in the matrix, the program may behave unexpectedly or crash.

## 🚧 Limitations
Some potential limitations of the program include:
* The program assumes that the user will input valid integer values for the row and column sizes, and for the elements in the matrix. If the user inputs invalid values, the program may behave unexpectedly or crash.
* The program uses a fixed-size array to store the matrix, which may limit the size of the matrix that can be input and processed.
* The program does not provide any mechanisms for saving or loading the matrix to or from a file, which may limit its usefulness in certain applications.
* The program does not provide any mechanisms for performing operations on the matrix, such as addition or multiplication, which may limit its usefulness in certain applications.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a simple example of how to read and display a two-dimensional array as a matrix in C. It demonstrates the use of nested loops and two-dimensional arrays, and provides a basic understanding of how to work with matrices in C. However, it is not a robust or flexible program, and may not be suitable for all applications. For more complex matrix operations, a more advanced program or library may be necessary.

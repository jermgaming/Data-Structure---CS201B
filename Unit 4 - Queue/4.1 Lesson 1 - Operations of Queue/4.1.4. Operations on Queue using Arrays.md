# 4.1.4. Operations on Queue using Arrays
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a queue data structure using an array, providing various operations to manipulate the queue. The program allows users to enqueue (add) elements, dequeue (remove) elements, display the queue, get the size of the queue, and check if the queue is empty.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a queue using an array and provide a basic understanding of queue operations. The program solves the problem of managing a collection of elements in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

## ✨ Key Features
* Enqueue (add) elements to the queue
* Dequeue (remove) elements from the queue
* Display the elements in the queue
* Get the size of the queue
* Check if the queue is empty
* Handle queue overflow and underflow conditions

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses a fixed-size array to implement the queue. The array is defined with a maximum size of 10 elements, and two indices, `front` and `rear`, are used to keep track of the front and rear of the queue, respectively. The `front` index points to the first element in the queue, and the `rear` index points to the last element in the queue.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms to implement the queue operations:
1. Enqueue: Check if the queue is full by comparing the `rear` index with the maximum size of the array minus 1. If it is full, print an error message and return. Otherwise, increment the `rear` index and add the new element to the queue.
2. Dequeue: Check if the queue is empty by comparing the `front` index with the `rear` index. If it is empty, print an error message and return. Otherwise, remove the element at the `front` index and increment the `front` index. If the `front` index becomes greater than the `rear` index, reset both indices to -1.
3. Display: Check if the queue is empty. If it is, print a message indicating that the queue is empty. Otherwise, iterate through the elements in the queue, starting from the `front` index, and print each element.
4. Size: Check if the queue is empty. If it is, print a message indicating that the queue size is 0. Otherwise, calculate the size of the queue by subtracting the `front` index from the `rear` index and adding 1.
5. IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty by comparing the `front` index with the `rear` index. If it is empty, print a message indicating that the queue is empty. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the queue is not empty.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `enqueue(int x)`
  - **Purpose**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
  - **Parameters**: `x` (the element to be added)
  - **Returns**: None (void)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the queue is full, increments the `rear` index, and adds the new element to the queue.
- **Function Name**: `dequeue()`
  - **Purpose**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (void)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the queue is empty, removes the element at the `front` index, and increments the `front` index.
- **Function Name**: `display()`
  - **Purpose**: Displays the elements in the queue.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (void)
  - **Logic**: Checks if the queue is empty, iterates through the elements in the queue, and prints each element.
- **Function Name**: `size()`
  - **Purpose**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (void), but prints the size of the queue.
  - **Logic**: Checks if the queue is empty, calculates the size of the queue, and prints the result.
- **Function Name**: `isEmpty()`
  - **Purpose**: Checks if the queue is empty.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: None (void), but prints whether the queue is empty or not.
  - **Logic**: Checks if the queue is empty and prints the result.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "4.1.4. Operations on Queue using Arrays.c" -o 4.1.4. Operations on Queue using Arrays
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./4.1.4. Operations on Queue using Arrays
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:
* Elements to be added to the queue (passed as arguments to the `enqueue` function)
* Choice of operation to perform (not explicitly passed as an argument, but implied by the function called)

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* Messages indicating the success or failure of each operation (e.g., "Queue is overflow.", "Deleted element = 5", etc.)
* The elements in the queue (printed by the `display` function)
* The size of the queue (printed by the `size` function)
* Messages indicating whether the queue is empty or not (printed by the `isEmpty` function)

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  * `enqueue`: O(1) (constant time) because the program only increments the `rear` index and adds the new element to the queue.
  * `dequeue`: O(1) (constant time) because the program only removes the element at the `front` index and increments the `front` index.
  * `display`: O(n) (linear time) because the program iterates through all the elements in the queue, where n is the number of elements in the queue.
  * `size`: O(1) (constant time) because the program only calculates the size of the queue by subtracting the `front` index from the `rear` index and adding 1.
  * `isEmpty`: O(1) (constant time) because the program only checks if the queue is empty by comparing the `front` index with the `rear` index.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (linear space) because the program uses an array of fixed size to store the elements in the queue, where n is the maximum size of the array.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enqueue 5: Successfully inserted.
Enqueue 10: Successfully inserted.
Display: Elements in the queue: 5 10
Dequeue: Deleted element = 5
Display: Elements in the queue: 10
Size: Queue size: 1
IsEmpty: Queue is not empty.
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* Queue overflow: The program checks if the queue is full before adding a new element. If it is full, the program prints an error message and returns.
* Queue underflow: The program checks if the queue is empty before removing an element. If it is empty, the program prints an error message and returns.
* Empty queue: The program checks if the queue is empty before displaying the elements or getting the size of the queue. If it is empty, the program prints a message indicating that the queue is empty.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* Fixed-size array: The program uses a fixed-size array to store the elements in the queue, which means that the queue has a limited capacity. If the queue is full and a new element is added, the program will print an error message and return.
* No error handling for invalid inputs: The program does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-integer values.
* No support for dynamic queue resizing: The program does not support dynamic queue resizing, which means that the queue size is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime.

## 📝 Notes
This program demonstrates a basic implementation of a queue using an array and provides a starting point for more complex queue operations. The program can be extended to support dynamic queue resizing, error handling for invalid inputs, and other advanced features.

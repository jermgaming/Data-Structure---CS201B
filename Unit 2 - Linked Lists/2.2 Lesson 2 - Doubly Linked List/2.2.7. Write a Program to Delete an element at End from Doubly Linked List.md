# 2.2.7. Write a Program to Delete an element at End from Doubly Linked List
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a doubly linked list (DLL) and provides functions to insert elements at the end of the list and delete elements from the end of the list. The program demonstrates the basic operations that can be performed on a doubly linked list, including creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to illustrate the implementation and usage of a doubly linked list in C. A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node has two pointers: `prev` and `next`. The `prev` pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the `next` pointer points to the next node in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.

## ✨ Key Features
* Implementation of a doubly linked list (DLL) in C
* Functions to insert elements at the end of the list
* Functions to delete elements from the end of the list
* Functions to traverse the list and print the data of each node
* Handling of edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one node

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The data structure used in this program is a doubly linked list (DLL). A DLL is a type of linked list where each node has two pointers: `prev` and `next`. The `prev` pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the `next` pointer points to the next node in the list. The DLL is defined as follows:
```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *prev;
    struct node *next;
};
typedef struct node *NODE;
```
Each node in the DLL has an integer `data` field and two pointers: `prev` and `next`. The `prev` pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the `next` pointer points to the next node in the list.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms:
* Insertion algorithm: The `insertAtEndInDLL()` function uses a simple insertion algorithm to add a new node at the end of the list. It traverses the list to find the last node and then appends the new node to it.
* Deletion algorithm: The `deleteAtEndInDLL()` function uses a simple deletion algorithm to remove the node at the end of the list. It traverses the list to find the last node, updates the `next` pointer of the previous node to `NULL`, and then frees the memory allocated to the deleted node.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `createNodeInDLL()`
  - **Purpose**: Creates a new node in the doubly linked list.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: A pointer to the newly created node (`NODE`)
  - **Logic**: Allocates memory for a new node, initializes its `prev` and `next` pointers to `NULL`, and returns a pointer to the new node.
- **Function Name**: `insertAtEndInDLL(NODE first, int x)`
  - **Purpose**: Inserts a new node with the given data at the end of the doubly linked list.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
    - `x`: The data to be inserted (`int`)
  - **Returns**: A pointer to the first node in the updated list (`NODE`)
  - **Logic**: Traverses the list to find the last node, creates a new node with the given data, and appends it to the last node.
- **Function Name**: `deleteAtEndInDLL(NODE first)`
  - **Purpose**: Deletes the node at the end of the doubly linked list.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
  - **Returns**: A pointer to the first node in the updated list (`NODE`)
  - **Logic**: Traverses the list to find the last node, updates the `next` pointer of the previous node to `NULL`, and then frees the memory allocated to the deleted node.
- **Function Name**: `traverseListInDLL(NODE first)`
  - **Purpose**: Traverses the doubly linked list and prints the data of each node.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
  - **Returns**: None
  - **Logic**: Traverses the list, printing the data of each node, until the end of the list is reached.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "2.2.7. Write a Program to Delete an element at End from Doubly Linked List.c" -o 2.2.7. Write a Program to Delete an element at End from Doubly Linked List
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./2.2.7. Write a Program to Delete an element at End from Doubly Linked List
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program does not take any explicit inputs from the user. However, the `insertAtEndInDLL()` function takes an integer value `x` as input, which is used to create a new node with the given data.

### Output
The program outputs the data of each node in the list when the `traverseListInDLL()` function is called. The `deleteAtEndInDLL()` function also prints the data of the deleted node.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `createNodeInDLL()`: O(1)
  - `insertAtEndInDLL()`: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list
  - `deleteAtEndInDLL()`: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list
  - `traverseListInDLL()`: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, since each node requires a constant amount of space.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
// Example output:
// Inserting nodes with data 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// Traversing the list: 1 <--> 2 <--> 3 <--> 4 <--> 5 <--> NULL
// Deleting the node at the end: 5
// Traversing the list after deletion: 1 <--> 2 <--> 3 <--> 4 <--> NULL
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:
* If the list is empty, the `deleteAtEndInDLL()` function returns `NULL` without attempting to delete a node.
* If the list has only one node, the `deleteAtEndInDLL()` function deletes the node and returns `NULL`.
* If the `insertAtEndInDLL()` function is called with an empty list, it creates a new node and returns a pointer to it.

However, the program does not handle the following error cases:
* If the memory allocation for a new node fails, the program does not handle the error.
* If the list becomes corrupted due to incorrect usage, the program does not detect or handle the error.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following potential issues or limitations:
* The program uses a simple insertion and deletion algorithm, which may not be efficient for large lists.
* The program does not handle errors or exceptions that may occur during memory allocation or deallocation.
* The program does not provide any mechanism for checking the integrity of the list or detecting corruption.
* The program does not provide any mechanism for sorting or searching the list.

## 📝 Notes
This program is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in production without proper testing and validation. Additionally, the program can be improved by adding error handling, implementing more efficient algorithms, and providing additional functionality such as sorting and searching.

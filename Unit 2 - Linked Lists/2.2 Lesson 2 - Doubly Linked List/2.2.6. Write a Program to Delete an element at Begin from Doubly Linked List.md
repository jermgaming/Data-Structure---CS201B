# 2.2.6. Write a Program to Delete an element at Begin from Doubly Linked List
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a doubly linked list (DLL) and provides functions to insert elements at the beginning of the list and delete elements from the beginning of the list. The program demonstrates the basic operations that can be performed on a doubly linked list, including insertion and deletion.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to create a doubly linked list and provide functions to insert and delete nodes at the beginning of the list. This program solves the problem of managing a dynamic collection of data, where elements need to be inserted and deleted efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features
*   Implementation of a doubly linked list (DLL) data structure
*   Insertion of elements at the beginning of the list
*   Deletion of elements from the beginning of the list
*   Traversal of the list to print the data of each node

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program implements and uses a doubly linked list (DLL) data structure. A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node has two pointers: `prev` and `next`, which point to the previous and next nodes in the list, respectively. The DLL is defined as follows:
```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *prev;
    struct node *next;
};
typedef struct node *NODE;
```
Each node in the DLL has an `int` field to store the data, a `prev` pointer to point to the previous node, and a `next` pointer to point to the next node.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms:

*   Insertion algorithm: The `insertAtBeginInDLL()` function uses a simple insertion algorithm to add a new node at the beginning of the list. It creates a new node, sets its `next` pointer to the current first node, and updates the `prev` pointer of the current first node to point to the new node.
*   Deletion algorithm: The `deleteAtBeginInDLL()` function uses a simple deletion algorithm to remove the node at the beginning of the list. It checks if the list is empty, and if not, it updates the `prev` pointer of the next node to `NULL` and frees the memory allocated to the node to be deleted.
*   Traversal algorithm: The `traverseListInDLL()` function uses a simple traversal algorithm to print the data of each node in the list. It starts at the first node and follows the `next` pointers until it reaches the end of the list.

### Functions Documentation
#### `createNodeInDLL()`
*   **Purpose**: Creates a new node in the doubly linked list.
*   **Parameters**: None
*   **Returns**: A pointer to the newly created node (`NODE`)
*   **Logic**: The function allocates memory for a new node, initializes its `prev` and `next` pointers to `NULL`, and returns the pointer to the new node.

#### `insertAtBeginInDLL(NODE first, int x)`
*   **Purpose**: Inserts a new node with data `x` at the beginning of the doubly linked list.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
    *   `x`: The data to be inserted (`int`)
*   **Returns**: A pointer to the updated first node in the list (`NODE`)
*   **Logic**: The function creates a new node using the `createNodeInDLL()` function, sets its `data` field to `x`, sets its `next` pointer to the current first node, and updates the `prev` pointer of the current first node to point to the new node.

#### `deleteAtBeginInDLL(NODE first)`
*   **Purpose**: Deletes the node at the beginning of the doubly linked list.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
*   **Returns**: A pointer to the updated first node in the list (`NODE`) or `NULL` if the list is empty
*   **Logic**: The function checks if the list is empty, and if not, it updates the `prev` pointer of the next node to `NULL` and frees the memory allocated to the node to be deleted.

#### `traverseListInDLL(NODE first)`
*   **Purpose**: Traverses the doubly linked list and prints the data of each node.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `first`: A pointer to the first node in the list (`NODE`)
*   **Returns**: None
*   **Logic**: The function starts at the first node and follows the `next` pointers until it reaches the end of the list, printing the data of each node.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "2.2.6. Write a Program to Delete an element at Begin from Doubly Linked List.c" -o 2.2.6. Write a Program to Delete an element at Begin from Doubly Linked List
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./2.2.6. Write a Program to Delete an element at Begin from Doubly Linked List
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program does not take any explicit inputs from the user. However, the `insertAtBeginInDLL()` function takes an integer `x` as input, which is used to create a new node with that data.

### Output
The program prints the data of each node in the list using the `traverseListInDLL()` function. It also prints the data of the node deleted from the list using the `deleteAtBeginInDLL()` function.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
*   **Time Complexity**:
    *   `createNodeInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `insertAtBeginInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `deleteAtBeginInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `traverseListInDLL()`: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list
*   **Space Complexity**:
    *   `createNodeInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `insertAtBeginInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `deleteAtBeginInDLL()`: O(1)
    *   `traverseListInDLL()`: O(1)

The overall time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. The overall space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

## 🧪 Example Run
```c
NODE first = NULL;
first = insertAtBeginInDLL(first, 10);
first = insertAtBeginInDLL(first, 20);
first = insertAtBeginInDLL(first, 30);
traverseListInDLL(first);
first = deleteAtBeginInDLL(first);
traverseListInDLL(first);
```
This example creates a doubly linked list with the nodes 30, 20, and 10, prints the data of each node, deletes the node at the beginning of the list, and prints the data of each node again.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:

*   Empty list: The `deleteAtBeginInDLL()` function checks if the list is empty and prints an error message if it is.
*   List with one node: The `deleteAtBeginInDLL()` function handles the case where the list has only one node.

The program does not handle the following edge cases:

*   NULL input: The program does not check if the input to the `insertAtBeginInDLL()` function is NULL.
*   Duplicate nodes: The program does not check for duplicate nodes in the list.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:

*   Memory leaks: The program does not check if the memory allocated to the nodes is freed properly.
*   NULL pointer dereferences: The program does not check if the pointers to the nodes are NULL before dereferencing them.
*   Infinite loops: The program does not check if the list has a cycle, which could cause an infinite loop in the `traverseListInDLL()` function.

## 📝 Notes
This program demonstrates the basic operations that can be performed on a doubly linked list, including insertion and deletion. It provides a foundation for more complex data structures and algorithms.

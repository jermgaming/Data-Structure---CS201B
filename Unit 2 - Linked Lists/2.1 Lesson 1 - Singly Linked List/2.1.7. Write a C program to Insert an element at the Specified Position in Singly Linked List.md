# 2.1.7. Write a C program to Insert an element at the Specified Position in Singly Linked List

## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a singly linked list (SLL) and provides a function to insert an element at a specified position in the list. The program allows users to create a new node, insert a node at a specific position, and traverse the list to display its elements.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a singly linked list and the insertion of elements at specified positions. It provides a basic understanding of how linked lists work and how to manipulate them. The program solves the problem of efficiently inserting elements at specific positions in a linked list.

## ✨ Key Features
*   Implementation of a singly linked list
*   Function to create a new node
*   Function to insert a node at a specified position
*   Function to traverse the list and display its elements
*   Handling of edge cases such as empty lists and invalid positions

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The primary data structure used in this program is a singly linked list (SLL). A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, and each element (or "node") points to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.

A node in the linked list is defined as follows:
```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};
typedef struct node *NODE;
```
Each node has an integer `data` field to store the node's value and a `next` field to point to the next node in the list.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The main algorithm used in this program is the insertion of a node at a specified position in the linked list. The steps involved are:

1.  Create a new node with the given data.
2.  If the list is empty, set the new node as the head of the list.
3.  If the position is 1, insert the new node at the beginning of the list.
4.  Otherwise, traverse the list to find the node at the specified position.
5.  Insert the new node at the specified position.

### Functions Documentation
#### `createNode()`
*   **Purpose**: Creates a new node in the singly linked list.
*   **Parameters**: None
*   **Returns**: A pointer to the newly created node (of type `NODE`)
*   **Logic**: Dynamically allocates memory for a new node and initializes its `next` field to `NULL`.

#### `insertAtPosition(NODE first, int pos, int x)`
*   **Purpose**: Inserts a new node with the given data at the specified position in the list.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `first`: The head of the singly linked list (of type `NODE`)
    *   `pos`: The position at which the new node is to be inserted (of type `int`)
    *   `x`: The data to be stored in the new node (of type `int`)
*   **Returns**: The head of the modified singly linked list (of type `NODE`)
*   **Logic**: Creates a new node with the given data and inserts it at the specified position in the list.

#### `traverseList(NODE first)`
*   **Purpose**: Traverses the singly linked list and prints the data of each node.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `first`: The head of the singly linked list (of type `NODE`)
*   **Returns**: None
*   **Logic**: Traverses the list from the head node to the last node, printing the data of each node.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "2.1.7. Write a C program to Insert an element at the Specified Position in Singly Linked List.c" -o 2.1.7. Write a C program to Insert an element at the Specified Position in Singly Linked List
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./2.1.7. Write a C program to Insert an element at the Specified Position in Singly Linked List
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:

*   The data to be stored in the new node (`x`)
*   The position at which the new node is to be inserted (`pos`)

### Output
The program produces the following output:

*   The modified singly linked list with the new node inserted at the specified position
*   The data of each node in the list, printed during traversal

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
*   **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the `createNode()` function is O(1) because it only involves a single dynamic memory allocation operation. The time complexity of the `insertAtPosition()` function is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because the function may need to traverse the entire list to find the node at the specified position. The time complexity of the `traverseList()` function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because the function visits each node in the list once.
*   **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because the program uses dynamic memory allocation to create new nodes, and the memory usage grows linearly with the number of nodes in the list.

## 🧪 Example Run
```c
int main() {
    NODE head = NULL;
    head = insertAtPosition(head, 1, 10);
    head = insertAtPosition(head, 2, 20);
    head = insertAtPosition(head, 3, 30);
    traverseList(head);
    return 0;
}
```
This code creates a new singly linked list, inserts three nodes with data values 10, 20, and 30, and then traverses the list to print the data of each node. The output will be:
```
10 --> 20 --> 30 --> NULL
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program handles the following edge cases:

*   If the list is empty and the position is not 1, an error message is printed, and the function returns `NULL`.
*   If the position is greater than the number of nodes in the list, an error message is printed, and the function returns the original list.
*   If the memory allocation for a new node fails, the program will terminate with an error message.

However, the program does not handle the following edge cases:

*   If the input data is invalid (e.g., a negative position), the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
*   If the list is very large, the program may run out of memory or experience performance issues.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following potential issues or limitations:

*   **Memory leaks**: If the program is not properly terminated, memory leaks may occur, causing the program to consume increasing amounts of memory.
*   **Performance issues**: If the list is very large, the program may experience performance issues due to the linear search algorithm used in the `insertAtPosition()` function.
*   **Error handling**: The program's error handling is limited, and it may not handle all possible error cases.
*   **Input validation**: The program does not validate the input data, which may lead to incorrect results or crashes.

## 📝 Notes
This program demonstrates the basic operations of a singly linked list, including node creation, insertion, and traversal. It provides a foundation for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms. However, it is essential to consider the limitations and potential issues when using this program in a real-world scenario.

# 2.6.9. List addition
## 📋 Overview
This C program is designed to add two linked lists representing numbers, where each node in the linked list represents a digit in the number. The program takes two linked lists as input, adds them together, and outputs the result as a new linked list.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the addition of two numbers represented as linked lists. This is a common problem in computer science and programming, and it requires a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. The program solves the problem by iterating through the linked lists, adding the corresponding digits, and handling any carry-over values.

## ✨ Key Features
* Adds two linked lists representing numbers
* Handles carry-over values
* Outputs the result as a new linked list
* Uses a singly linked list data structure
* Implemented in C programming language

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses a singly linked list data structure, where each node in the list represents a digit in the number. The linked list is defined using a `struct node` with two members: `data` (an integer representing the digit) and `next` (a pointer to the next node in the list). The linked list is created and manipulated using functions such as `insertAttail` and `inserttail`.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize two pointers, `t1` and `t2`, to the heads of the two input linked lists.
2. Initialize a carry variable to 0.
3. Iterate through the linked lists, adding the corresponding digits and the carry:
	* Calculate the sum of the current digits and the carry.
	* Update the carry and the result linked list accordingly.
	* Move to the next nodes in the linked lists.
4. Repeat steps 3 until one of the linked lists is exhausted.
5. If there is a remaining carry, add it to the result linked list.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `insertAttail(struct node* head)`
  - **Purpose**: Inserts a new node at the end of the linked list.
  - **Parameters**: `head` (pointer to the head of the list)
  - **Returns**: `head` (updated head of the list)
  - **Logic**: Reads an integer from the user, allocates a new node, and inserts it at the end of the list.
- **Function Name**: `inserttail(struct node* head, int x)`
  - **Purpose**: Inserts a new node with the given value at the end of the linked list.
  - **Parameters**: `head` (pointer to the head of the list), `x` (integer value to be inserted)
  - **Returns**: `head` (updated head of the list)
  - **Logic**: Allocates a new node, sets its value to `x`, and inserts it at the end of the list.
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: The entry point of the program, responsible for reading input, adding the two linked lists, and printing the result.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: 0 (indicating successful execution)
  - **Logic**: Reads the number of nodes in the input linked lists, creates the linked lists, adds them together, and prints the result.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "2.6.9. List addition.c" -o 2.6.9. List addition
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./2.6.9. List addition
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects two linked lists as input, where each node in the linked list represents a digit in the number. The input is provided through the `scanf` function, which reads integers from the user. The program first reads the number of nodes in the first linked list (`n`) and the number of nodes in the second linked list (`m`). Then, it reads the values of the nodes in each linked list.

### Output
The output of the program is the result of adding the two input linked lists, represented as a new linked list. The output is printed to the console using the `printf` function.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists. This is because the program iterates through each node in the linked lists once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists. This is because the program creates a new linked list to store the result, which has a maximum length of n + m.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter the number of nodes in the first linked list: 3
Enter the values of the nodes in the first linked list: 1 2 3
Enter the number of nodes in the second linked list: 3
Enter the values of the nodes in the second linked list: 4 5 6
Output: 5 7 9
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle any edge cases or errors explicitly. However, it assumes that the input linked lists are non-empty and that the user provides valid input. Some potential edge cases that are not handled include:
* Empty input linked lists
* Invalid input (e.g., non-integer values)
* Linked lists with different lengths

## 🚧 Limitations
Some potential issues or limitations of the program include:
* Memory leaks: The program uses `malloc` to allocate memory for the linked list nodes, but it does not free the memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks if the program is run repeatedly.
* Limited input range: The program assumes that the input linked lists represent numbers with a limited range (i.e., integers). If the input linked lists represent larger numbers, the program may overflow or produce incorrect results.
* Lack of error handling: The program does not handle any errors that may occur during input or processing. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the program encounters invalid input or errors.

## 📝 Notes
This program demonstrates the addition of two numbers represented as linked lists. It uses a singly linked list data structure and implements a simple iterative algorithm to add the linked lists. The program has a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists. However, it does not handle any edge cases or errors explicitly and has some potential limitations, including memory leaks and limited input range.

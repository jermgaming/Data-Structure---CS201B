# 2.6.7. Occurrences of given key
## 📋 Overview
This C program is designed to count the occurrences of a given key in a linked list. It creates a linked list by inserting nodes at the head, then traverses the list to find and count the occurrences of a specified key.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a linked list and the traversal algorithm to count the occurrences of a given key. This program solves the problem of efficiently counting the occurrences of a specific value in a dataset, which can be applied to various domains and applications.

## ✨ Key Features
* Creates a linked list by inserting nodes at the head
* Traverses the linked list to count the occurrences of a given key
* Prints the linked list with each node's value separated by an arrow (`-->`)
* Prints the count of occurrences of the specified key

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The data structure used in this program is a singly linked list. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, and each element (or node) points to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list. The linked list is defined as follows:
```c
struct node{
    int data;
    struct node* next;
};
```
Each node in the linked list has two fields: `data` to store the value of the node, and `next` to point to the next node in the list.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses a simple algorithm to insert nodes at the head of the linked list and traverse the list to count the occurrences of a given key. The steps are as follows:
1. Read an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of nodes to insert into the linked list.
2. Create an empty linked list by initializing the `head` pointer to `NULL`.
3. Loop `n` times, inserting a new node at the head of the linked list using the `insertAthead` function. Each node's value is read from the input.
4. Read an integer `x` from the input, representing the key to be searched for in the linked list.
5. Initialize a counter `ans` to 0, which will store the count of occurrences of the specified key `x`.
6. Traverse the linked list, starting from the head node, using a `while` loop.
7. Inside the loop, print the current node's value, followed by an arrow (`-->`).
8. Check if the current node's value is equal to the specified key `x`. If it is, increment the `ans` counter.
9. Move to the next node in the list by updating the `temp` pointer to point to the current node's `next` field.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 until the end of the linked list is reached (i.e., `temp` becomes `NULL`).
11. Print the string "Null" to indicate the end of the linked list.
12. Print the final value of the `ans` counter, which represents the count of occurrences of the specified key `x`.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `insertAthead(struct node* head)`
  - **Purpose**: Inserts a new node at the head of the linked list.
  - **Parameters**: `head` - a pointer to the head of the linked list.
  - **Returns**: A pointer to the updated head of the linked list.
  - **Logic**: The function allocates memory for the new node, sets its `data` field to the input value, and updates the `next` field to point to the current head.
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: The entry point of the program, responsible for creating the linked list, counting the occurrences of a given key, and printing the result.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: An integer indicating the program's exit status (0 for success).
  - **Logic**: The function reads input from the user, creates the linked list, and traverses the list to count the occurrences of the specified key.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "2.6.7. Occurrences of given key.c" -o 2.6.7. Occurrences of given key
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./2.6.7. Occurrences of given key
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program takes the following inputs:
* An integer `n`, representing the number of nodes to insert into the linked list.
* `n` integers, representing the values to be inserted into the linked list.
* An integer `x`, representing the key to be searched for in the linked list.

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* A printed representation of the linked list, with each node's value separated by an arrow (`-->`).
* The count of occurrences of the specified key `x` in the linked list.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the program traverses the linked list once to count the occurrences of the specified key.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the program uses a linked list to store the input data, which requires O(n) space.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter the number of nodes: 5
Enter the values: 1 2 3 2 4
Enter the key: 2
Output:
1-->2-->3-->2-->4-->Null
Count of occurrences of 2: 2
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle the following edge cases:
* If the input `n` is negative, the program will enter an infinite loop.
* If the input `x` is not an integer, the program will produce undefined behavior.
* If the linked list is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the program will not print anything.
* If the program runs out of memory while allocating nodes, it will produce undefined behavior.
To handle these edge cases, the program could add input validation, error checking, and memory management mechanisms.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* The program uses a singly linked list, which can be inefficient for large datasets or frequent insertions/deletions.
* The program does not handle errors or exceptions, which can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
* The program uses a simple traversal algorithm, which can be slow for very large linked lists.
* The program does not provide any mechanism for deleting nodes or updating the linked list.
To address these limitations, the program could be modified to use a more efficient data structure (e.g., a doubly linked list), add error handling mechanisms, or implement more efficient algorithms for traversal and insertion/deletion.

## 📝 Notes
The program demonstrates the implementation of a linked list and the traversal algorithm to count the occurrences of a given key. This program can be applied to various domains and applications, such as counting the occurrences of a specific word in a text document or tracking the frequency of a particular item in a database.

# 1.4.1. Understanding Binary search
## 📋 Overview
This C program implements a binary search algorithm to find a specific key element in a sorted array. It first takes input from the user to populate an array, sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm, and then performs a binary search to find the key element.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of a binary search algorithm in a sorted array. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. This program exists to solve the problem of finding a specific element in a large dataset efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features
* Takes input from the user to populate an array
* Sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm
* Performs a binary search to find a key element in the sorted array
* Displays the sorted array and the position of the key element if found
* Handles cases where the key element is not found in the array

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program uses the following data structures:
* **Array**: A one-dimensional array `a` of size 20 is used to store the input elements. The array is defined as `int a[20]`, which means it can store 20 integer values. The array is used to store the input elements, and its size is fixed at 20.
* **Variables**: Various integer variables such as `n`, `key`, `flag`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `temp` are used to store temporary values and control the flow of the program. These variables are used to store the size of the array, the key element, and the indices of the array.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The program uses the following algorithms:
* **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm is used to sort the input array in ascending order. The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
* **Binary Search**: This algorithm is used to find the key element in the sorted array. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

The step-by-step breakdown of the main algorithm is as follows:
1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array `n`.
2. The program prompts the user to enter the elements of the array `a`.
3. The program sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
4. The program prompts the user to enter the key element `key`.
5. The program initializes the `low` and `high` variables to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
6. The program enters a while loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
7. Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[low, high]`.
8. The program checks if the element at the midpoint `mid` is equal to the key element `key`. If it is, the program sets the `flag` variable to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
9. If the element at the midpoint `mid` is less than the key element `key`, the program updates the `low` variable to `mid + 1`.
10. If the element at the midpoint `mid` is greater than the key element `key`, the program updates the `high` variable to `mid - 1`.
11. After the loop, the program checks the value of the `flag` variable. If it is 1, the program prints a message indicating that the key element is found at the position `mid`. Otherwise, the program prints a message indicating that the key element is not found.

### Functions Documentation
* **`main()`**: This is the entry point of the program, and it does not take any parameters or return any values. It is responsible for executing the entire program.
	+ **Purpose**: Execute the program
	+ **Parameters**: None
	+ **Returns**: None
	+ **Logic**: The `main()` function prompts the user to enter the size of the array, the elements of the array, and the key element. It then sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm and performs a binary search to find the key element.
* **`printf()`**: This function is used to print output to the console. It takes a format string and variable number of arguments as parameters and returns the number of characters printed.
	+ **Purpose**: Print output to the console
	+ **Parameters**: Format string and variable number of arguments
	+ **Returns**: Number of characters printed
	+ **Logic**: The `printf()` function is used to print messages to the console, such as prompts for user input and results of the binary search.
* **`scanf()`**: This function is used to read input from the console. It takes a format string and variable number of arguments as parameters and returns the number of successful assignments.
	+ **Purpose**: Read input from the console
	+ **Parameters**: Format string and variable number of arguments
	+ **Returns**: Number of successful assignments
	+ **Logic**: The `scanf()` function is used to read input from the user, such as the size of the array, the elements of the array, and the key element.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.4.1. Understanding Binary search.c" -o 1.4.1. Understanding Binary search
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.4.1. Understanding Binary search
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program takes the following inputs:
* The size of the array `n`
* The elements of the array `a`
* The key element `key`

### Output
The program produces the following outputs:
* The sorted array
* The position of the key element if found, or a message indicating that the key element is not found

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n^2) + O(log n) = O(n^2) because the bubble sort algorithm dominates the binary search algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, and the binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.
* **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(1) because the program uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input array and variables.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter value of n : 5
Enter element for a[0] : 5
Enter element for a[1] : 2
Enter element for a[2] : 8
Enter element for a[3] : 1
Enter element for a[4] : 9
Enter key element : 8
After sorting the elements in the array are
Value of a[0] = 1
Value of a[1] = 2
Value of a[2] = 5
Value of a[3] = 8
Value of a[4] = 9
The key element 8 is found at the position 3
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle the following edge cases:
* If the user enters a negative value for the size of the array `n`, the program will not work correctly.
* If the user enters a value for the key element `key` that is outside the range of the array, the program will not work correctly.
* If the user enters duplicate elements in the array, the program will still work correctly but may not find the correct position of the key element.

The program does not have any error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input or unexpected errors.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following potential issues or limitations:
* The bubble sort algorithm is not efficient for large input arrays, and the program may take a long time to execute.
* The program uses a fixed-size array, which may not be sufficient for large input arrays.
* The program does not handle duplicate elements in the array, which may cause incorrect results.
* The program does not have any error handling mechanisms, which may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results in case of invalid input or unexpected errors.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a simple implementation of a binary search algorithm in a sorted array. It is not intended for use in production environments and is for educational purposes only. The program can be improved by using more efficient sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, and by adding error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input or unexpected errors.

# 1.4.2. Write a Program to Search an element using Binary Search and Recursion
## 📋 Overview
This C program is designed to search for a specific element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm and recursion. The program includes functions to read input from the user, sort the array using bubble sort, display the array, and perform the binary search.

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary purpose of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of the binary search algorithm using recursion to find an element in a sorted array. The program solves the problem of efficiently searching for an element in a large dataset by utilizing the divide-and-conquer approach of binary search, which significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed compared to linear search methods.

## ✨ Key Features
* Reads input from the user and stores it in an array
* Sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm
* Displays the sorted array
* Searches for a specific element in the sorted array using the binary search algorithm and recursion
* Handles edge cases where the element is not found in the array

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program primarily uses arrays as its data structure. An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. In this program, arrays are used to store the input elements and to perform the binary search. The array is defined with a fixed size, and its elements are accessed using index values.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the next interval will be the lower half. Otherwise, the next interval will be the upper half. The process is repeated until the size of the interval is zero, at which point the search key is not in the array.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `void read1(int arr[], int size)`
  - **Purpose**: Reads input from the user and stores it in the array.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `arr`: The array to store the input elements.
    - `size`: The number of elements to read from the user.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: The function uses a for loop to iterate `size` times, prompting the user to enter an element each time and storing it in the corresponding index of the `arr` array.
- **Function Name**: `void bubbleSort(int arr[], int size)`
  - **Purpose**: Sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `arr`: The array to sort.
    - `size`: The number of elements in the array.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: The function uses nested for loops to compare each pair of adjacent elements in the array. If the elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.
- **Function Name**: `void display(int arr[], int size)`
  - **Purpose**: Displays the elements of the array.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `arr`: The array to display.
    - `size`: The number of elements in the array.
  - **Returns**: None (void).
  - **Logic**: The function uses a for loop to iterate over the array, printing each element.
- **Function Name**: `int binarySearch(int arr[], int start, int end, int key)`
  - **Purpose**: Searches for the `key` element in the sorted array using the binary search algorithm and recursion.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `arr`: The sorted array to search.
    - `start`: The starting index of the search range.
    - `end`: The ending index of the search range.
    - `key`: The element to search for.
  - **Returns**: The index of the `key` element if found, -1 otherwise.
  - **Logic**: The function calculates the middle index of the current search range. If the middle element matches the `key`, its index is returned. If the `key` is less than the middle element, the function recursively searches the lower half of the range. If the `key` is greater than the middle element, the function recursively searches the upper half of the range. If the search range becomes empty, the function returns -1 to indicate that the `key` is not in the array.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.4.2. Write a Program to Search an element using Binary Search and Recursion.c" -o 1.4.2. Write a Program to Search an element using Binary Search and Recursion
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.4.2. Write a Program to Search an element using Binary Search and Recursion
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the user to input the number of elements to read from the user, followed by the elements themselves.

### Output
The program displays the sorted array and the index of the searched element if found, or a message indicating that the element was not found.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The `read1` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements to read.
  - The `bubbleSort` function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - The `display` function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - The `binarySearch` function has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The program has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since it uses an array to store the input elements.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter 5 elements : 3 1 4 1 5
1 1 3 4 5 
Enter the element to search: 4
Element 4 found at index 3
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not include explicit error handling for edge cases such as:
- Non-integer input
- Negative number of elements
- Empty array
However, it handles the case where the searched element is not found in the array by returning -1.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
- The bubble sort algorithm used for sorting has a high time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large arrays.
- The program does not validate the user's input for correctness (e.g., checking for non-integer values).
- The binary search function assumes the array is sorted in ascending order. If the array is not sorted, the function may produce incorrect results.

## 📝 Notes
This program is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating the use of binary search and recursion in a C program. For practical applications, more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, and input validation should be considered.

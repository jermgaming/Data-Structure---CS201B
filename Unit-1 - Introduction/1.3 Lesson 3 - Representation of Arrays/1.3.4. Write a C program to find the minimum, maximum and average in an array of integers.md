# 1.3.4. Write a C program to find the minimum, maximum and average in an array of integers

## 📋 Overview
This C program is designed to find the minimum, maximum, and average values in an array of integers. The program prompts the user to input the number of elements in the array, followed by the elements themselves, and then calculates and displays the minimum, maximum, and average values of the input array.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide a simple and efficient way to calculate statistical measures (minimum, maximum, and average) from a set of integer values. This can be useful in various applications, such as data analysis, scientific computing, and educational settings, where understanding basic statistical properties of a dataset is essential.

## ✨ Key Features
* Calculates the minimum value in the array
* Calculates the maximum value in the array
* Calculates the average value of the array elements
* Handles arrays of up to 20 integer elements
* Prompts the user for input and displays the results

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used
The program utilizes the following data structures:
* **Arrays**: A one-dimensional array `arr` of size 20 is used to store the input integers. Arrays in C are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element is identified by an index or subscript that allows the program to access and manipulate the elements.
* **Variables**: Several integer variables (`number`, `sum`, `min`, `max`) and a floating-point variable (`avg`) are used to store intermediate results and the final output. These variables are used to keep track of the number of elements, the sum of the elements, the minimum and maximum values, and the average value.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Algorithm Explanation
The main algorithm of the program can be broken down into the following steps:
1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to input the number of elements in the array (`number`) and then reads each element into the `arr` array using a `for` loop.
2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the `min` variable to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`) and the `avg` variable to 0.0.
3. **Calculation**: The program iterates through the array using a `for` loop, performing the following operations:
   * It adds each element to the `avg` variable.
   * It checks if the current element is less than the current `min` value. If so, it updates the `min` value.
   * It checks if the current element is greater than the current `max` value. If so, it updates the `max` value.
4. **Average Calculation**: After the loop completes, the program calculates the average value by dividing the `avg` variable by the `number` of elements.
5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum, maximum, and average values to the console using `printf()`.

### Functions Documentation
- **Function Name**: `main()`
  - **Purpose**: This is the entry point of the program, responsible for executing the main logic.
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: `void`
  - **Logic**: The `main` function prompts the user for input, calculates the minimum, maximum, and average values, and then displays the results.
- **Function Name**: `scanf(format, &variable)`
  - **Purpose**: Reads input from the user and stores it in the specified variable.
  - **Parameters**: `format` (a string specifying the type of input), `&variable` (the address of the variable to store the input)
  - **Returns**: The number of successful assignments
  - **Logic**: The `scanf` function is used to read input from the user, such as the number of elements and the array elements themselves.
- **Function Name**: `printf(format, variables)`
  - **Purpose**: Prints output to the console.
  - **Parameters**: `format` (a string specifying the format of the output), `variables` (the values to be printed)
  - **Returns**: The number of characters printed
  - **Logic**: The `printf` function is used to display the minimum, maximum, and average values to the console.

## 💻 Compilation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc "1.3.4. Write a C program to find the minimum, maximum and average in an array of integers.c" -o 1.3.4. Write a C program to find the minimum, maximum and average in an array of integers
```

### Running the Program
```bash
./1.3.4. Write a C program to find the minimum, maximum and average in an array of integers
```

## 📥 Input/Output

### Input
The program expects the following inputs:
* The number of elements in the array (`number`)
* The array elements themselves (`arr`)

### Output
The program produces the following output:
* The minimum value in the array (`min`)
* The maximum value in the array (`max`)
* The average value of the array elements (`avg`)

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the program iterates through the array once to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average values.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the program is O(1), because the program uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input array and intermediate results. The size of the input array is limited to 20 elements, so the space complexity is constant.

## 🧪 Example Run
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5
Min: 1, Max: 5, Avg: 3.00
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
The program does not handle the following edge cases:
* **Invalid input**: The program does not check if the user input is valid. If the user enters a non-integer value or a value outside the range of the `int` type, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
* **Empty array**: The program does not handle the case where the user enters 0 as the number of elements. In this case, the program will produce incorrect results or crash.
* **Array overflow**: The program does not check if the input array exceeds the maximum size of 20 elements. If the user enters a larger array, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

## 🚧 Limitations
The program has the following limitations:
* **Limited array size**: The program is limited to arrays of size 20 or less. If the user needs to process larger arrays, the program will need to be modified to use dynamic memory allocation.
* **Integer overflow**: The program uses `int` variables to store the sum and average values. If the input array contains very large values, the program may produce incorrect results due to integer overflow.
* **Lack of error handling**: The program does not handle errors or invalid input. This may make the program more difficult to use or debug.

## 📝 Notes
This program is a basic implementation of a statistical calculator and can be used as a starting point for more complex applications. It is essential to consider the limitations and edge cases when using this program in real-world scenarios.
